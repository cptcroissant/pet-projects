# PyTorch russian language sentiment analysis

The idea is to create a model, which may classify the restaurant' reviews and helps managers improve service quality.   
 
The solution is a PyTorch model with GRU achitecture and RuBert embeddings.   
With only 900 train examples I've reached a 88% accuracy. 

The output of the model shows us a probability of a sample review belonging to a positive class.
